# Multi-Scale-Transformer-Analysis-for-Areca-Nut-Harvesting
This project automates ArecaNut classification and harvesting using transformer models like MViT and Swin Transformer. It classifies ArecaNuts into five categories: ripened, unripened, semi-ripened, over-ripened, and diseased. The system is designed for integration with robotic harvesting for real-time operation.
